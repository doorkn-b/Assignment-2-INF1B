## Main justification
The idea of dealing with a straightforward problem having numerous solutions insighted my curiosity and made me choose this challenge for my assignment.

I found this topic interesting for myself due to the problem that arises when the length of the string is even and how many ways it can be solved. Although very straightforward, the implementation was fun even as an intermediate. I believe it is easy for me to explain to beginners as I'm not very far off from that description myself, although have come a long way since the start of university. The approach I have used is very beginner friendly in theory but implementation can be tricky if unaware how to handle types and values. I believe it suits great for an assignment to a beginner.

## Confidence ##

The problem being straightforward makes it have so many ways to solve it. That I feel is the specialty about this challenge. And naturally code-golf has 40 different solutions. This confided in me the quality of this problem and how it can force a beginner to use their own method to do the challenge in whatever way they feel, ie., encourage creativity.
